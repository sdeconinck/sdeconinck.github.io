I attended the <a href="https://en.itu.dk/Research/PhD-Programme/PhD-Courses/Archive/PhD-courses-2022/August/PhD-Symposium---Summer-School-on-Privacy-Preserving-Machine-Learning">Summer School on Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning 2022 </a> at Copenhagen, Denmark. I followed many intresting sessions on MPC, Homomorphic Encryption, Federated Learning and Differential Privacy.
